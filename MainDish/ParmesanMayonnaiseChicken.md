# Parmesan Mayonnaise Chicken

## Ingredients
- 4 skinless boneless chicken breasts trimmed
- 1 cup mayonnaise
- 1/2 cup Parmesan cheese grated
- 1 1/2 teaspoon seasoning salt
- 1 teaspoon garlic powder
- 1/2 teaspoon pepper
- 1/3 cup Italian bread crumbs

## Instructions
1. Preheat oven to 375 convection or 400 regular. Trim and pat dry 3-4 skinless boneless chicken breasts.
1. Mix in a medium bowl 1 cup mayonnaise, 1/2 cup Parmesan cheese (fresh shredded preferred), 1 1/2 tsp seasoning salt, 1 t garlic powder and 1/2 t pepper.
1. Prepare a cooking sheet with aluminum foil (to help clean up) and a rack. The rack will help crispness all around. You can do without the rack, but the bottom will not be crispy. Give the rack a good spray of PAM.
1. Dip the chicken breasts in the mayonnaise Parmesan mixture. Be sure to get all surface coated. Finger use allowed but be sure to wash well after.
1. Lightly sprinkle with some Italian bread crumbs on both sides. I used about 1/3 cup on three large breasts. You are not coating them. Just adding some crispy and flavor.
1. Bake until internal temp of 165. This will vary by oven but mostly by the size of the chicken breast. About 40 minutes for medium to large. 45 minute for huge. Let rest for 5 to 10 minutes before serving.
