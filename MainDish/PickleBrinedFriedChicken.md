# Pickle Brined Fried Chicken

## Ingredients
- 3 large chicken breasts
- 16 oz. jar of pickles, just the juice (try finding one with 0-1 carbs per serving)
- 2 cups peanut oil (or whatever oil you prefer to fry with)
- 4 oz. plain pork rinds, finely crushed
- 2 whole eggs, beaten

## Instructions
1. Place chicken breasts and pickle juice in a freezer-sized ziplock bag. Store in fridge overnight to brine.
1. Drain pickle juice from bag.
1. Slice chicken breast into tender or nuggets, whatever you prefer.
1. One at a time, place a strip of chicken in egg wash and then in the bowl of crushed pork rinds. Press down to get the coating to stick-the wetness of the pickle juice on the help the crumbs to stick.
1. Place on a plate until you are ready to fry.
1. In a medium sized fry pan, heat peanut oil over medium-high heat. You donâ€™t need a lot, just enough to cover half the chicken tender.
1. Fry on each size of chicken for 2-3 minutes, until golden brown.
1. Place chicken tenders cool on a paper towel-lined plate until all are fried.
1. Serve with Chilpotle Aioli *see recipe below.
