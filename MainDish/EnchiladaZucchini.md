# Enchilada Zucchini

## Ingredients
- 4 medium zucchini (about 7 or 8 inches long)
- Olive oil or olive oil spray
- Kosher salt
- Garlic powder (optional)
- 1 pound ground beef
- 1 onion, chopped
- 1 (15-ounce) can enchilada sauce with no sugar added (the brand Hatch makes a good one)
- 1 ½ cups shredded cheese: cheddar, Jack, mozzarella, or a blend
- Cilantro leaves for garnish
- Sour cream for serving

## Instructions
1. Heat the oven to 375 and line a rimmed baking sheet with parchment paper or oil it.
2. Prepare the zucchini: Cut them in half lengthwise, leaving the ends on so they’ll maintain their integrity in the oven. Use a melon baller or a nice sharp teaspoon to scoop out the seeds and insides, leaving about a ¼-inch shell (save the insides and chop them up to use in the filling). Spray or brush the inside of the zucchini with olive oil, then sprinkle them with salt and, if you like, garlic powder.
3. Put the zucchini cut-side down on the baking sheet and pop it in the oven while you prepare the filling. You want the squash to be tender but not falling apart; check them at 20 minutes by poking the tip of a sharp knife near the stem. Take them out of the oven when they’re ready and flip them over.
4. Meanwhile heat a large frying pan over medium-high heat (don't use a nonstick pan for this) and, when it’s hot enough that a drop of water sizzles and evaporates, crumble in the ground beef. Cook and stir the meat, breaking up clumps with a spatula, until it is just browning, around 2 minutes.
5. Add the onion and ½ teaspoon of kosher salt and sauté until the onion is just about see-through, another 5 to 10 minutes (the fat from the meat will fry the onions nicely, so please don’t drain it).
6. Add the chopped zucchini innards stir until everything is nice and cooked, around another 5 minutes. Finally, add the enchilada sauce and stir and simmer another 5 minutes, until some of the liquid has cooked off. Now taste the filling: you want it to be a little too salty so that it can season the zucchini (this is like using deviled egg filling to season bland egg whites). Add more salt if it needs it.
7. Use a spoon to scoop the filling into the zucchini shells, and mound it up attractively but stop before it’s falling out all over the place (you will likely have some filling left over, which you can eat with a spoon or serve with the zucchini). Sprinkle on the cheese and pop the zucchini back in the oven for 15-20 minutes, or until the squash is tender and the cheese is bubbling. Top with cilantro leaves and serve with a dollop of sour scream.
