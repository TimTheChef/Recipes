# Firecracker Casserole

## Ingredients
- 2 pounds ground beef
- 1 onion, chopped
- 2 tablespoons chili powder
- 1 tablespoon ground cumin
- 1/2 teaspoon salt
- 4 (7 inch) flour tortillas
- 1 (14.5 ounce) can diced tomatoes with green chili peppers

## Instructions
1. Preheat an oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9x13-inch baking dish.
1. Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and stir the ground beef with the onion in the hot skillet until completely browned, 7 to 10 minutes; drain any excess fat. Stir the chili powder, cumin, and salt to the beef mixture; cook and stir until hot, about 5 minutes. Pour the mixture into the prepared baking dish. Arrange the tortillas atop the beef mixture.
