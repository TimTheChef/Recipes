# Cauliflower Rice

## Ingredients
- 1 large head cauliflower 

## Instructions
1. Wash and thoroughly dry cauliflower, then remove all greens and cut into 4 even sections (see photo).
1. With a box grater, use the medium-sized holes (see photo - the side commonly used to grate cheese), or a food processor with the grater attachment, to grate the cauliflower into the size of rice, leaving any large, tough stems behind.
1. Transfer to a clean towel or paper towel and press to remove any excess moisture, which can make your dish soggy.
1. Once you have your cauliflower rice, it's easy to cook! Simply saut√© in a large skillet over medium heat in 1 Tbsp oil. Cover with a lid so the cauliflower steams and becomes more tender. Cook for a total of 5-8 minutes, then season as desired (such as with soy sauce or salt and pepper).
1. Use cauliflower rice in recipes that call for rice, such as stir fries, fesenjan, or fried rice!
