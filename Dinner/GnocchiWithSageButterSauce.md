# Gnocchi With Sage Butter Sauce

## Ingredients
- 2 (12 ounce) packages potato gnocchi
- 1/4 cup butter
- 1 clove garlic, minced
- 1 teaspoon dried sage
- 1/4 teaspoon salt
- 1/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese
- 1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper
- 2 tablespoons grated Parmesan cheese

## Instructions
1. Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil over high heat. Add the gnocchi pasta, and cook until they float to the surface, 2 to 3 minutes; drain.
1. Melt the butter in a skillet over medium heat. Stir in the garlic, and cook until the garlic has softened and is beginning to turn golden brown, about 4 minutes. Stir in the sage and salt for a few seconds, then add the cooked gnocchi. Toss gently with 1/4 cup of Parmesan cheese and the pepper. Sprinkle with the remaining 2 tablespoons Parmesan cheese to serve.
