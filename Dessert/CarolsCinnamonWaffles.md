# Carol's Cinnamon Waffles

## Ingredients
- 2 cups all-purpose flour
- 1/4 cup white sugar
- 1/2 cup brown sugar
- 2 1/2 teaspoons ground cinnamon
- 4 teaspoons baking powder
- 1/4 teaspoon salt
- 1 3/4 cups milk
- 1/2 cup vegetable oil
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
- 2 egg whites

## Instructions
1. Whisk flour, white sugar, brown sugar, cinnamon, baking powder, and salt together in a bowl until no lumps remain.
1. Pour milk, vegetable oil, and vanilla extract into the flour mixture; stir until just combined.
1. Beat egg whites until foamy in a large glass or metal mixing bowl until soft peaks form. Lift your beater or whisk straight up: the egg whites will form soft mounds rather than a sharp peak.
1. Fold the the beaten egg whites into the batter.
1. Preheat a waffle iron and coat with cooking spray.
1. Pour batter onto waffle iron in batches and cook until crisp and golden brown, about 2 minutes; repeat until all batter is used.
