## Notes
I suggest using the following tools when making these cookies.

Cookie Scoop: Make each cookie exactly the same size, looks good and makes sure each cookie cooks the same.

Silicon Baking Mats: These are amazing for cookies, they make clean up easier, and the cookies just slide off of them.

Cooling Rack: The cookies will keep cooking too long if left on the hot cookie sheet, so itâ€™s good to use a cooling rack to finish them properly.
