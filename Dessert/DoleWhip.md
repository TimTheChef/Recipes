# Dole Whip

## Ingredients
- 2 cups frozen pineapple
- 1/4 cup milk of choice (Try canned coconut milk for pi√±a colada soft serve!)
- 1/16 tsp salt
- 2 tbsp sugar
- 1 tbsp lemon juice

## Instructions
1. Blend all ingredients until smooth. Scoop out with an ice cream scoop, or squeeze through a pastry bag or a plastic bag with an edge cut off. (If your blender is not super-powerful like a Vita-Mix, you may need to add a little more liquid and then freeze a bit before serving, or churn in an ice cream maker.) For soft-serve that holds its shape longer, freeze the swirled dole whip at least 20 minutes prior to serving.
